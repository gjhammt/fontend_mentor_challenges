        <ul>
          <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
          <li>Salt, to taste</li>
          <li>Pepper, to taste</li>

    Instructions Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt
    and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or
    milk for a fluffier texture. Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over
    medium heat and add butter or oil. Cook the omelette: Once the butter is
    melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs
    evenly coat the surface. Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set
    at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your
    chosen fillings over one half of the omelette. Fold and serve: As the
    omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
    fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate. Enjoy:
    Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed. Nutrition The table
    below shows nutritional values per serving without the additional fillings.
